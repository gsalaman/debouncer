/*============================================================================
 * DEBOUNCER LIBRARY
 *
 * This library provides a simple method to debounce a pin in software.
 *
 * USAGE: 
 *   First, create debouncer object for the pin in question.  You can optionally
 *   specify a debounce time...if none is provided, 50 ms is used.
 *
 *   Instead of doing digitalReads from the pin, you can then use the "read" 
 *   method in order to read the pin in question.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *   This library uses millis() for timing.
 *   It assumes that reads happen much faster than the debounce time.
 *   the "debug" method will turn on and off debug information via the 
 *   serial port.  It assumes that you have initialized that port seperately.
 *
 * For more information, see the associated wiki in github.
